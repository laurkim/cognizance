# Cognizance

Cognizance is a game built on Vanilla JavaScript with a Ruby on Rails backend. Cognizance is inspired from a memory game I was taught as a child that I played with physical cards. As an experiment into the world of JavaScript, this game was built to translate something I was familiar with into code.

The images rendered on the back of each card are of snacks. They are randomized and rendered in a nonspecific assortment on the board. Every card will have one matching pair card. To see the image of the snack on the back of each card, a user must click on the card to trigger the flip. As a catch, a user can only flip two card faces at a time.

The main objective of Cognizance is to find all the matches as quickly as possible with the least amount of card flips as possible. The lower the number of clicks a user makes to find all card matches, the higher the user's final score.

The more a user plays, the more they will be able to memorize card placements better and make quicker matches. Based on this analysis, there are increasing levels of difficulty provided to ensure the user continues to learn with prolonged use.
