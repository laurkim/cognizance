# Cognizance

Cognizance is a game built on Vanilla JavaScript with a Ruby on Rails backend. The inspiration behind this game was on a memory game I was taught as a child that I played with physical cards. As an experiment into the world of JavaScript, this game was built to translate something I was familiar with into code.

To see examples of how this game works, please visit [this](https://github.com/laurkim/cognizance-demo) repository for a demo.
